                    <h3>What is Aptitute?</h3>
                    <p>Aptitute is a leading AI company focused on innovative solutions and transforming data into actionable insights. Its mission is to build an AI platform that enables individuals to earn from the valuable data they generate every day.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What problem does Aptitute solve?</h3>
                    <p>The future of AI hinges on two simple variables: compute and data. But there's a problem. We are rapidly exhausting our stockpile of publicly available training data, and we do not have a reliable and equitable way of sourcing this data from scratch. Aptitute is changing this by building a platform that creates and augments datasets for training and tuning AI models.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does Aptitute solve this problem?</h3>
                    <p>Tackling these challenges requires a radically new platform. A platform that is owned, powered, and governed by its community. One that can frictionlessly coordinate the actions of millions of individuals through programmable incentives. And a platform that transforms data collection into a fun, engaging, and global phenomenon. To execute on this vision, we are releasing Aptitute, an application that gamifies the collection of data by rewarding users for actively contributing high-value training data through quests and passively contributing data streams through connections.</p>
